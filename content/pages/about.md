Title: About

Hello! I'm a developer from Melbourne.
I have a design background and switched into software development where I found a perfect middle ground between creativity and logic. I focus in web development with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as React and TypeScript. I also love the simplicity and power of Python, and have built android apps with Java, and games with Unity and C#.
